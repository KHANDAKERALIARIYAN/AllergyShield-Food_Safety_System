# AllergyShield: Food Safety System

AllergyShield is a personal Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to help users detect potential allergens in food items. It enhances food safety by allowing users to scan food names and receive alerts about possible allergenic ingredients.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Allergen Detection**: Detects common allergens in input food items.
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Clean OOP structure for maintainability and expansion.
- 🧾 **Customizable Dataset**: Easily update allergen lists in the `allergy_data` directory.
- 🖥️ **Console-Based Interface**: Lightweight and easy to run.


## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
